<div><h1>Mire - Goa#16</h1><i>Release date: Aug 9, 2022</i><br><br>Gnomes found some magical mushrooms in the forest so it's time for a party. Finally I tried LMMS (Linux multimedia studio) on Linux. I tried to make everything with integrated sampler in LMMS and I did it! It was fun making this tune in lmms. I used only lmms internal effects and synths and samplers.<br><br><a href="mp3/Mire-Goa16.mp3" download="Mire-Goa16.mp3"><img src="mp3.svg"></a><a href="https://youtu.be/EQ0exla2DEI?feature=shared"><img src="ytgray.svg"></a><a href="https://mirens.bandcamp.com/track/goa-trance-16"><img src="bcgray.svg"></a></div>
