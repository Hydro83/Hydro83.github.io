<div><h1>Mire - Goa#5</h1><i>Release date: Mar 3, 2019</i><br><br>Youtube version of this track is bad, I didn't rest my ears and I uploaded it with too much bass. This version is a little cleaner. Someone in the youtube comments said it reminded him of the rising sun, so I put appropriate image. This was my first track made on Linux in free tracktion (Daw). Mainly Tal-Noisemaker used and Calf plugins suite.<br><br><a href="mp3/Mire-Goa5.mp3" download="Mire-Goa5.mp3"><img src="mp3.svg"></a><a href="https://youtu.be/jsQpWvhLc8w?feature=shared"><img src="ytgray.svg"></a><a href="https://mirens.bandcamp.com/track/goa-trance-5"><img src="bcgray.svg"></a></div>
