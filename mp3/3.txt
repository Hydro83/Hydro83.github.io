<div><h1>Mire - Goa#3</h1><i>Release date: Jan 2, 2019</i><br><br>Ah this one... I bought SynthMasterOne (synth), Xpand!2 (synth) and Hybrid (synth) + a lot of free Melda plugins. Plugins were sold for 1$ and I tried them. Everything was fine on first export of the track, but when I wanted to export it in a better quality SynthMasterOne on the next open forgot its parameters and I had to recreate one sound from scratch. I came close but this version and version on youtube are a little different.<br><br><a href="mp3/Mire-Goa3.mp3" download="Mire-Goa3.mp3"><img src="mp3.svg"></a><a href="https://youtu.be/U4hAoTvpYKg?feature=shared"><img src="ytgray.svg"></a><a href="https://mirens.bandcamp.com/track/goa-trance-3"><img src="bcgray.svg"></a></div>
