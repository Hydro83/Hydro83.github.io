<div><h1>Mire - Goa#2</h1><i>Release date: Apr 15, 2018</i><br><br>Second track... A little better than the first one but still a little rusty. It was made again in a Jeskola Buzz (Daw) using only free plugins. A lot of charlatan (synth), Phazor (phaser), TAL-U-NO-62 (synth), Ambience (reverb). I had a lot of problems exporting this one because reverb had some noise bursts and glitches so this was the best export :D<br><br><a href="mp3/Mire-Goa2.mp3" download="Mire-Goa2.mp3"><img src="mp3.svg"></a><a href="https://youtu.be/vlPmKbwXsmY?feature=shared"><img src="ytgray.svg"></a><a href="https://mirens.bandcamp.com/track/goa-trance-2"><img src="bcgray.svg"></a></div>
